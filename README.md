# Diabetes-Prediction-Model
This project is a ML model which aims to predict diabetes from a given dataset of people (Pima India). 
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict diabetes based on various medical attributes. Early prediction of diabetes can significantly help individuals take necessary precautions and modify their lifestyle to manage or even prevent this chronic disease.
